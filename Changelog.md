# Changelog

## `0.0.4`

 - Add: Sheet Picker

The sheet picker lives below the sheet, and allows you to switch between sheets
in a workbook.
This was intended for `0.1.0`, but adding row heights will require either a fork
of SlickGrid, or a whole new grid. I don't want to release a UX-breaking change
as a minor release, so this got bumped up.

## `0.0.3`

 - Fix: Row Indexing starts at 1 (#4)
 - Fix: Model indexing left off last row and column
 - Add: Cell Merges

The grid now supports cell merges! Merges work horizontally, vertically, or
both.

## `0.0.2`

 - Bugfix release: add keywords to NPM registry

This was released shortly after 0.0.1, and added community-standard keywords
to make this plugin discoverable.

## `0.0.1`

 - Initial release.
